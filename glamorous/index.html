<p><a href="http://www.swinginout.ca/">Swingin&#8217;OUT</a>, Toronto&#8217;s queer swing dance group, is holding a fundraiser to help <a href="http://www.the519.org/">The 519</a> pay for a super swanky dance floor in their newly renovated building. Our fundraiser, <strong>Glamorous: A Tribute to the Jazz Age</strong>, will be an incredible evening of glitz and glamour, with a 1920&#8217;s, 30&#8217;s and 40&#8217;s theme. This event will be held at Buddies In Bad Times Theatre, on the evening of April 26. Audience will be invited to dress in their jazz-era finest, and we&#8217;ll be holding a silent auction with some fabulous items, including dance lessons from Swingin&#8217;OUT.</p>

<p>The show will feature performances inspired by, about, or to music of the Jazz Age. Think Hollywood glamour. Think WWII underground cabarets. Think wild music and sultry torch singers. Think jazz babies, flappers, and men and women in uniform. (For inspiration, check out <a href="http://faculty.pittstate.edu/~knichols/jazzage.html">some history</a> or <a href="http://www.pbs.org/jazz/time/time_depression.htm">some music</a>.)</p>

<p>There is still some room to add acts, so we are continuing to accept submissions from anyone interested in performing. We will choose the line-up for the night with goals of providing an entertaining and varied show that could draw a wide audience, so we hope to provide a nice mix of dance, drag, burlesque, cabaret, and other styles of performance. Proposals should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>name of the performer(s)</li>
<li>what song/artist you plan to perform to</li>
<li>general description of the performance and how it relates to the theme</li>
<li>any audio/visual needs you have</li>
<li>contact information</li>
<li>if you have a website or Facebook/MySpace profile, a link to more information about the performer(s).</li>
</ul>

<p>Email proposals to <a href="mailto:glamorous@swinginout.ca">glamorous@swinginout.ca</a>. If you have any questions, please let us know.</p>

<p>Because this is a fundraiser, all the money we raise will be donated to The 519. Performers will receive a guest pass at the door, and our undying gratitude.</p>

<p class="center" style="clear: right">GLAMOROUS: A TRIBUTE TO THE JAZZ AGE<br/>
Queer Swing Dance Troupe to Stage Jazz Era Benefit for The 519 Church Street
Community Centre</p>

<p>Toronto - On Sunday, April 26, Swingin&#8217;OUT, Toronto's celebrated
queer swing dance group, will present an evening of entertainment, inspired by
the 1920's, 30's and 40's, featuring dance, drag, and burlesque performances
in support of The 519 Capital Campaign. The evening will take place at Buddies
in Bad Times Theatre, 12 Alexander Street. Doors open at 8 pm, and the show
will begin at 9 pm. Tickets are $10 in advance (available at The 519, 519
Church Street), $12 at the door.</p>

<p>Hosted by local drag sensation Samantha Stone, Glamorous will feature some
of the city's most talented and colourful performers, including Ceci My
Playmate, Dick DuBois, Donnarama, Skin Tight Outta Sight, The Saucy Tarts,
Bobby Pinn, Breakprance Crew, PushPULL Dance, and Swingin&#8217;OUT.</p>

<p>A fundraiser for The 519 Church Street Community Centre, the event is open
to all members of the public, who are encouraged to don their jazz-era finery
and join Swingin&#8217;OUT and other performers on the dance floor after the
show. A silent auction will also take place. All proceeds from the evening
will go directly to The 519 Capital Campaign, and the first $4000 raised will
be matched by an anonymous donor.</p>

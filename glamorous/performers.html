<div class="bio"><h4>Samantha Stone</h4>
<p>Samantha Stone began performing in the Toronto queer community just over a
year ago and has already taken the drag scene by storm. She recently placed
fourth in this year's Drag Idol and has trained for various aspects of theatre
at the University of Windsor. Samantha is very community-oriented, so she is
thrilled that she can take part in this fundraiser to help support the
cornerstone of our community, The 519 Community Centre.</p>

<p>Bobby Pinn, also known as 'The Little Tramp,' began his performance career

<div class="bio"><h4>Breakprance Crew</h4>

<p>Breakprancing was born when Charleston and breakdancing met in a bathhouse
lobby. It has been a torrid love affair between these dances of the
disenfranchised. Breakprance Crew looks to put the queer into crew, the
bottoms into toprock' tops into downrock and to showcase just how gay both
breaking and swinging can be when they get together. It's their first time
performing in Toronto -- please don't be gentle, they'll feel neglected.</p>

<div class="bio"><h4>Mademoiselle Cr&egrave;me Br&ucirc;l&eacute;e</h4>

<p>Mademoiselle Cr&egrave;me Br&ucirc;l&eacute;e was born in France and spent
her early life training in boudoirs around Paris. She then backpacked
(figuratively because ladies don't carry backpacks) across Europe and down
towards India where she trained in Indian classical dance. It was in Bombay
where she was discovered by an agent from London (England). After a stint in
London's West End she migrated to Broadway and more recently, to Toronto where
she currently resides.</p>

<div class="bio"><h4>Dick DuBois</h4>

<p>Dick DuBois first appeared on the scene among the shifting, fleshy, groping
shadows of a fashionable opium den on the west side of London, circa 1896.
Remarkably well preserved and vigorous, given his advanced age and dubious
beginnings, DuBois now contentedly resides in the New World and enjoys
lechery, buggery, and needlepoint. Keenly self-conscious and excruciatingly
shy, he prefers the shadows to the spotlight, but has taken up burlesque out
of a perverse devotion to the Protestant Work Ethic, with a view to
self-betterment through self-abnegation.</p>

<p>He sincerely hopes that you are ready for this jelly.<p>

<div class="bio"><h4>Skin Tight Outta Sight</h4>

<p>Skin Tight Outta Sight Rebel Burlesque is recognized as one of Canada's
pioneers in the Burlesque Revival. With nine years of sold-out shows under
their sequined belts, this troupe bridges the gap between retro and
revisionist with influences such as classical ballet, bump 'n grind, Motown
and just plain Out There!</p>

<p>Skin Tight Outta Sight has a strong history of community involvement.
Using burlesque to challenge stereotypes around gender, body size, diversity
and feminism, the troupe performs regularly at festivals and fundraisers for
local arts organizations and social agencies. They are the founders of The
Toronto Burlesque and Vaudeville Alliance, which welcomes other ecydysiasts to
"Take it off!" in their fair city. In 2008, Skin Tight Outta Sight teamed with
other luminaries of the alternative arts scene to produce Toronto's first
juried International Burlesque Festival.</p>

<div class="bio"><h4>Swingin&#8217;OUT</h4>

<p>Swingin&#8217;OUT is Canada's only queer swing dance group. Founded in
2000, Swingin&#8217;OUT now has a long history of teaching swing dancing to,

and performing for, Toronto's LGBTQ community. Swingin&#8217;OUT dances Lindy
Hop, the original form of swing dancing from the 1930's and 40's, as well as
related dances from the same era, including Charleston, Balboa, and Blues.
Swingin&#8217;OUT has performed at Toronto Pride, the AIDS Walk for Life, the
Toronto Lindy Hop Homegrown Cabaret, and has been known to spontaneously break
out into dance on subways, in restaurants, and at Cawthra Square Park.</p>

<p>Swingin&#8217;OUT offers swing dance lessons for beginners and experienced
dancers every Thursday.</p>

<div class="bio"><h4>The Saucy Tarts</h4>

<p>The Saucy Tarts have been high-kicking their way across Toronto stages
since 2003. From the roots of their manic-panic hair to the toes of their
shit-kicking boots, the Tarts are committed to giving traditional cancan a
kick in its frilly knickers!</p>

<p>They've had the pleasure of performing with a wild variety of artists from
burlesque babes Skin Tight Outta Sight to the sensational musical duo The Wet
Spots. Past performances include Pride Toronto (three years running!), a
picket line cabaret in support of locked-out CBC workers, community
fundraisers and private parties. The Tarts have enjoyed exposure in magazines
including Xtra, fab, Outlooks and Trade, and were featured in the short film
<cite><a href="http://www.artlitwell.com/moviemachine.htm">Vive Le
Cancan</a></cite> by Art Litwell and the documentary <cite>A Straight Guide To
Pride</cite>.

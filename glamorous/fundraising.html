<h1>Swingin&#8217;OUT for The 519</h1>
</div>

<p>Dear friend,</p>

<p>If you've walked through the Church Wellesley Village at any point over the
last few years, you probably couldn't help but notice that
<a href="http://www.the519.org/">The 519 Church Street Community Centre</a>
has been undergoing a major expansion.</p>

<p>Since opening its doors in 1975, The 519 has played a critical role in
responding to the needs of the local neighbourhood and the broader Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTTQ) communities. The
519's programs have addressed poverty, violence, the needs of families, and
the HIV/AIDS crisis, among many other important issues. The 519 has served as
a gathering place where diverse communities meet, participate and celebrate.
It has provided space for over 300 groups from all across the city, devoted to
everything from learning and development to experiencing life as it was meant
to be.</p>

<p>However, by the beginning of this decade, our communities' demands for
facilities greatly excceeded the space available in the modest building.
Groups were being asked to meet less often and hundreds of requests for space
were being turned down each year.</p>

<p>Now, The 519's expansion is nearing completion. The new wing has taken
shape, and extensive reconfiguration and refurbishment is underway on the
original structure. A final fundraising push is needed to help The 519 achieve
its goals for our communities.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swinginout.ca/">Swingin&#8217;OUT</a>, Toronto's queer
swing dance group, is helping to close the gap. We are one of many community
groups that will find a permanent home at The 519 once the expansion is
complete. Our <em>Swingin&#8217;OUT for The 519</em> campaign is collecting
donations from our members and the community to benefit The 519 Capital Fund
and, thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor, the first $4000 we raise
will be matched.</p>

<p>What better way to give back to our own community than by helping The 519
grow and thrive? This building, in the heart of Toronto's GLBTTQ community, is
a beacon that cannot be allowed to dim. It is a shining example to all
community centres across Canada that our community can work side by side with
other diverse groups to make a better society.</p>

<p>You can donate in person, by mail, or online. Tax receipts will be issued
by The 519 for donations of $10 or more.</p>

<h4>In Person</h4>

<p>All regular Swingin&#8217;OUT dancers are collecting donations. You can
also make your donation at Swingin&#8217;OUT's Thursday evening dance classes
at Saint Luke's Church, 353 Sherbourne St. Donations are welcome from 8:30 to
9:00 and, while you're there, why not stay for our beginner class?</p>
